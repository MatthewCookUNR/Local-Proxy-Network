# Project Overview
The main goal of the project is to allow devices in a network to communicate with each other in a way that is programmed by the users themselves. Clients establish a TCP connection with a server to perform actions such as registering, deregistering, messaging, and querying for data. The server is connected to a SQLite database to save user data and provide information to clients. The clients will be able to use a GUI to perform actions in the proxy network.
