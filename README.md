# Project Overview
The project aims to create a proxy network that allows the server owner to customize how users communicate. Clients establish a TCP connection with a server to perform actions such as registering, deregistering, messaging, and querying for data. The server is connected to a SQLite database to save user data and provide information to clients. The clients will be able to use a GUI to perform actions in the proxy network.
